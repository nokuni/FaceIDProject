# FaceIDProject

This app, in SwiftUI, can show the basic use of the FaceID tech, by locking or unlocking a chest.
I found a simple use of the framework here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/using-touch-id-and-face-id-with-swiftui
And I started implementing my faceID view model. I splitted and cleaned the code. Then I added the views respecting the given Figma design.
